    <h1>Favority City</h1>
    <p>Salt Lake City was founded in 1847 by settlers led by Brigham Young who were seeking to escape persecution they
        had
        experienced while living farther east. The Mormon pioneers, as they would come to be known, entered a semi-arid
        valley
        and immediately began building an extensive irrigation network that could feed the population and foster future
        growth.

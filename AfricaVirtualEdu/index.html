                    Each year, Africa Virtual Education (AVE) launches an Annual Project
                    focused on a specific educational need. This year, we are supporting
                    high school students in the Democratic Republic of Congo who face
                    severe financial difficulties that threaten their ability to continue
                    their studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Join us by donating, partnering, or volunteering. Together, we can
                    bring hope and education to the next generation of African leaders.
